# Reflection Questions

### 1. How did array methods like push() and filter() help you manipulate data in this activity?

- Array methods made it easier to work with the shopping list without having to write a lot of extra code. `push()` let me quickly add new items to the list, and `filter()` helped me search through the list to find matching items without creating lengthy loops. These methods looped through the list without needing to add the extra code.

### 2. What challenges did you face when trying to filter and search for items in the array?

- The main challenge was understanding what I was actually comparing. At first, I mixed up the search word with the items in the array and ended up comparing the same thing to itself. I also struggled to figure out how to make the search case-insensitive to ignore upper and lower case letters.

### 3. How would you modify this code to make it more efficient or user-friendly?

- I would improve this code by dynamically adding the search results to the browser instead of using alerts or the console. I could also add better feedback messages, like telling the user when no matches are found.
